      "The Question Paper Creation System is designed for Hindi schools and colleges to streamline the process of generating question papers. It supports different question paper formats, such as 10 two-mark questions, 5 thirteen-mark questions, and 1 fifteen-mark question. The system automatically assigns Bloom’s taxonomy levels—Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and Create—by matching keywords in the entered questions with a predefined database. Additionally, it generates course outcomes without requiring manual input. Before submission, all fields are validated, ensuring accuracy. Faculty members can also retrieve their question papers using a question paper ID and faculty ID, formatting them into a structured layout. This system enhances efficiency, consistency, and accuracy in question paper creation.",
